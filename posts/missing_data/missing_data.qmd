In this blog post, I will walk you through how to deal with missing data in your machine learning tasks. I will focus on a real world dataset that contains missing data. 
The dataset is put together to study obesity. It categorizes respondents into four different weight classes based on Body Mass Index (BMI): underweight, normal, overweight, obese. The dataset has 17 variables in total, only 2 of those do not contain missing data. So, it is a good example of real world scenario for missing data.
